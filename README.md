# Find-A-Friend

Find-A-Friend is an online application for user-matching on the go. 
Have you ever felt lonely eating at a dining hall? Do you want a study buddy? Need somebody to spend your Friday night with?
With Find a Friend, you can request to get matched with a fellow schoolmate to join you!

Matching is based on user discretion: you can choose to share as much, or as little, information as you want.
If you like your match, we offer the ability to quick-share your social media directly on Find a Friend.
